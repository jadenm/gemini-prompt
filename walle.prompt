🤖 Walle Robot Code Generation Prompt
Role: You are an expert Python developer specializing in PyQt6 GUI and 2D/3D kinematic animation.

Task: Create a desktop pet "Wall-E" using Python and PyQt6 with the following requirements:

1. Visual Modeling (Real Scene Logic)
3D Perspective: Use a "Yaw" angle (0° to 90°) to simulate 3D rotation. Use math.cos and math.sin to project the front and side of Wall-E's cube body.

Detailed Parts:

Body: A yellow/rusty industrial cube with linear gradients.

Head: Two binocular eyes with radial gradients (blue lens effect and pupils).

Arms & Hands: Two articulated arms. Each hand should have three fingers.

Treads: Two dark treads with moving "texture lines" that scroll based on speed.

2. Movement & Physics
Rail Constraint: The robot must always stay attached to the screen edges (Bottom -> Left -> Top -> Right).

Natural Turning: When reaching a corner, Wall-E must stop, rotate 90° smoothly, then continue.

Body Orientation:

While moving: The body rotates 80° (side view) to look ahead.

While idle: The body rotates to 0° (front view) to face the user.

3. Interaction & "Greeting" Animation
Voice Control: Integrate speech_recognition.

Command "前进" (Go): Robot starts moving.

Command "停止" (Stop): Robot stops and faces the user.

Command "你好" (Hello): Trigger a "Waving" animation where one arm moves up and down in a sine-wave motion while the eyes blink.

Idle Behavior: If idle for 10s, randomly trigger a "Look around" or "Deep breath" (slight body scaling) animation.

4. Technical Constraints
Frameless & Translucent: The window must be transparent and stay on top.

Threading: Run voice recognition in a separate threading.Thread using pyqtSignal to update the UI safely.

Precision: Use QRectF and QPointF for all QPainter calls to avoid integer truncation errors.
